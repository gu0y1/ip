# üìå Istella Project
**A Java-based CLI task management assistant**

---

## **Introduction**
**Istella** is a lightweight and interactive **command-line chatbot** that helps you manage your daily tasks efficiently. You can add different types of tasks, mark them as done, and list them in an organized manner. Istella is built using Java and follows an incremental development approach.

### **üöÄ Features**

  - **Event**: Tasks with a start and end time (e.g., `event team meeting /from 2pm /to 4pm`)
- **Task Completion**
  - Mark tasks as done (`mark 2`) or not done (`unmark 2`)
- **Task Listing**
  - View all added tasks (`list`)
- **User-friendly CLI**
  - Istella interacts with users through an easy-to-use command-line interface.

## **‚ö† Important Notes**
- **Keep all Java files inside `src/main/java/`**  
  - Do not rename or move this directory, as tools like Gradle rely on it.
- **Use Java 17**  
  - Running the project with a different Java version may cause compatibility issues.

## **üìö Further Enhancements**
- Implement **persistent storage** (save tasks to a file)
- Add **natural language processing** for smarter interactions
- Implement **graphical user interface (GUI)** using JavaFX
